<h3>Generate Tabs for Your Guitar</h3>

The purpose of this project is to create a platform for guitarists to easily record a song and automatically generate music sheets for that song.

By building a web platform, we are making our technology more readily available to the population, without the need for any external hardware or expensive software. All you have to do turn on your computer's microphone and you are ready to get started.

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (ES6)

Back-end dependencies:
- Node.js / Npm
- Express - `npm install express`
- Express Handlebars - `npm install express-handlebars`
- Mongoose - `npm install mongoose`
- Pitchy - `npm install pitchy`

Milestones:
- Create shell node project
- Have server register audio input from microphone
- Populate database of chord references (audio)
- Have server differentiate between references
